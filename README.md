## Hi 👋

I'm a Computer Science student graduating soon, currently focused on building software systems and learning through hands-on development.

Right now I'm spending most of my time on blockchain development, primarily on Solana — experimenting, building small systems, and learning how things work under real constraints.

This profile is where I push things I'm working on, experiments, and projects as I learn and improve.

---

### Current focus
- Software engineering fundamentals
- Blockchain development (Solana)
- Systems thinking through real projects

---

### What you'll find here
- Small to medium projects
- Experiments and prototypes
- Ongoing learning, not polished products (yet)

Always learning, always building.
