## Hey there 👋

I'm a Computer Science student graduating soon, focused on building software systems and learning through hands-on development.

A lot of the work I do lives in private repositories, but this profile reflects the things I can share publicly — experiments, side projects, and ongoing learning.

Recently, I’ve been spending most of my time on blockchain development, primarily on Solana, building and experimenting under real-world constraints.
